Unfortunately, Kompose is not available in the official Debian repositories, so you cannot install it using the apt package manager. However, you can still install Kompose on Debian by downloading the binary directly from the official GitHub repository. Here's how

Open a terminal window.

Download the Kompose binary by running the following command

Copy code
curl -L httpsgithub.comkuberneteskomposereleaseslatestdownloadkompose-linux-amd64 -o kompose
This command downloads the Kompose binary for Linux.

After the download is complete, make the binary executable by running

bash
Copy code
chmod +x kompose
Move the binary to a directory listed in your system's PATH environment variable. For example, you can use the usrlocalbin directory by running

bash
Copy code
sudo mv kompose usrlocalbin
Note The sudo command may prompt you for your password.

Verify the installation by opening a new terminal window and running

Copy code
kompose version
If the installation was successful, you should see the version information of Kompose.

That's it! You have now installed Kompose on Debian and can use it to convert Docker Compose files to Kubernetes manifests.

VCClient (MIT etc.) is quite actively maintained and offers web-based GUI for real-time conversion.
fish-diffusion tried to be quite modular but not quite actively maintained.
yxlllc/DDSP-SVC - new releases are issued occasionally. yxlllc/ReFlow-VAE-SVC
coqui-ai/TTS was for TTS but was partially modular. However, it is not maintained anymore, unfortunately.

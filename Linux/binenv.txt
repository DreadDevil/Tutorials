You can install binenv from the Github repository by following these steps:

First, download the latest version of binenv for your operating system from the releases page. For example, if you're on a Linux system, you would do:
bash
Copy code
curl -Lo binenv https://github.com/devops-works/binenv/releases/latest/download/binenv_linux_amd64
Make the downloaded file executable:
bash
Copy code
chmod +x binenv
Move the executable to a directory in your PATH. For example, you could move it to /usr/local/bin:
bash
Copy code
sudo mv binenv /usr/local/bin/
Verify the installation by checking the version of binenv:
bash
Copy code
binenv --version
Please note that the above commands assume a Unix-like environment (such as Linux or MacOS). If you're using a different operating system, the process might be slightly different. Be sure to adapt the commands to your specific environment.

mkdir -p /root/.binenv/shim
